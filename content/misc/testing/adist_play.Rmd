This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}

library(robCompositions)
data(expenditures)
x <- xOrig <- expenditures
## Aitchison distance between two 2 observations:
aDist(x[1, ], x[2, ])

## Aitchison distance of x:
aDist(x)

## Example of distances between matrices:
## set some missing values:
x[1,3] <- x[3,5] <- x[2,4] <- x[5,3] <- x[8,3] <- NA

## impute the missing values:
xImp <- impCoda(x, method="ltsReg")$xImp

## calculate the relative Aitchsion distance between xOrig and xImp:
aDist(xOrig, xImp)

data("expenditures") 
aDist(expenditures)  
x <- expenditures[, 1]
y <- expenditures[, 2]
aDist(x, y)
aDist(expenditures, expenditures)


```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
