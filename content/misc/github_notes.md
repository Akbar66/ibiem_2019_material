Permissions on Remote Repositories
==================================

Github
------

The optinos for permissions on Github are very limited: - [Permission levels for a user account repository](https://help.github.com/articles/permission-levels-for-a-user-account-repository/) - [Repository permission levels for an organization](https://help.github.com/articles/repository-permission-levels-for-an-organization/)

Gitlab
------

Gitlab gives you much greater flexibility in setting repository permissions: \[Gitlab Permissions\] (<https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html>)

Bitbucket
---------

Bitbucket seems to be more flexible tham Github, but less that Gitlab: [Grant repository access to users and groups](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucket/grant-repository-access-to-users-and-groups-221449716.html)
