Here are different examples of how to download data from different types of sources. The first one is particularly useful for getting the data for the [Software Carpentry R Lessons](http://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder/). Note that all of these will download the data to your IBIEM computing environment, not you local computer.
